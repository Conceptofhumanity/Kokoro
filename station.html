<body class="station-body">
  <p>Hello, this is the station, where you can navigate this land.</p>
  <p>You don't need to know a lot about it, which is to  say I don't know a lot about it.</p>
  <p>There are countless buttons I don't know what do.</p>
  <p>These 6 that are glowing are the ones we care about, unless you think you can somehow unlock the rest.</p>
  <p>You have to input a password, and then this here train will take you to whatever area you want to go to.</p>
  <p>Now go get that first password, or enter it, I dunno, I'm not omniscient.</p>

</body>
