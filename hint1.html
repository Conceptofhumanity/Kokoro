    <p class="first-paragraph">Start out by clicking somewhere. If you clicked on a mine, tough luck.</p>
    <p class="first-paragraph">The number you now see is the number of mines that are adjacent to that cell.</p>
    <p class="first-paragraph">No numbers means no mines.</p>
    <p class="first-paragraph">If you clicked on a space that has mines near it, just click around for one with none. 
        That's not necessary but it is highly reccomended</p>
    <p class="first-paragraph">You can mess around with this one, with mines revealed.</p>
    <p class="first-paragraph">It is also far harder than minesweeper usually ought, because my code is bad. Keep this in mind.</p>
